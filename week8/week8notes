Markov chain Monte Carlo is a simulation technique producing a sequence of dependent variates(iterates) drawn from the posterior.

Overview
Multiple chains

Most software packages provide automatic tuning, called "adaptation".

"burn-in": running the chain until transient effects(do not reflect the posterior) are gone, then using only the iterations after this. 
  ("warm-up" in BDA3)
  
General MCMC process


Accessing Convergence
"trace plot": of a scalar sampled node is a line plot of its value versus the iteration number.

Gelman-Rubin
variance->"Gelman-Rubin statistics" 

Passing convergence tests does not guarantee convergence.


Autocorrelation and Mixing
"autocorrelation at lag t": the correlation between two samples of psi that are t iterations apart

Prefer quicker decay


Mixing
fast(preferred), slow


Monte Carlo Error and sample size
"Monte Carlo standard error"

"effective sample size"

asymptotic version


Thinning

overdispersed: extremely large or small
