Markov chain Monte Carlo is a simulation technique producing a sequence of dependent variates(iterates) drawn from the posterior.

Overview
Multiple chains

Most software packages provide automatic tuning, called "adaptation".

"burn-in": running the chain until transient effects(do not reflect the posterior) are gone, then using only the iterations after this.

General MCMC process


Accessing Convergence
"trace plot": of a scalar sampled node is a line plot of its value versus the iteration number.

Passing convergence tests does not guarantee convergence.
